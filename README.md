# Overview

I wanted to play around with a simple Iphone app that displayed a random image. I wanted to explore mobile apps and since I have an iPhone I decided create an iOS app. The app itself displays a random photo from the internet each time the use clicks a button.

The main goal of this project was to learn more about iOS mobile apps and how they worked, specifically the process to implement an app and get it running on the app store.

As an added challenge I used my windows 11 laptop to run a virtual macOS to use Xcode to develop my app
